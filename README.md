Employee Complaint Portal 

Tech Stack: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
I built a user-friendly Employee Complaint Portal to replace the IT department’s old, manual complaint system. The platform enables employees to log technical issues easily and allows the IT team to track and resolve them in real time. I implemented RESTful APIs, role-based authentication, and optimized the UI/UX for better accessibility and performance. This system significantly improved efficiency and organization in handling employee complaints.
